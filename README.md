### Disclaimer

Please note that as Just Natsuki is currently undergoing a complete overhaul, any/all mod content under the overhaul is liable to change or be removed without prior warning.

In addition, we unfortunately no longer offer support to those running the (now-outdated) older version of Just Natsuki, as we are focusing our efforts on a version that will completely supercede the old distribution.

If you are looking for a complete mod experience, this is not something we are ready to offer just yet: please rest assured that announcements will be made when the time comes, and we make every attempt to keep our community updated through our official communication channels (GitHub, Twitter and Discord).

However, if you are interested in helping to making Just Natsuki the best it can be, we welcome your support!
Please feel free to clone the repository, suggest new content by raising an issue, or try out the mod yourself and let us know about any problems by raising bug reports.

#### In short

- Do not expect a complete, polished experience at this stage in development.
- Do not expect progress made by playing under the overhaul to be supported into release, or further in development: you may need to delete your persistent to play newer versions of JN before release.
- Progress made by playing under the old distribution of Just Natsuki will not be supported in the overhaul.
- Do not expect support if you are playing the old distribution of Just Natsuki. It is **discontinued**.

### Installation

1. Download a fresh copy of DDLC from https://ddlc.moe.
2. Extract/unzip DDLC.
3. Download the JN mod files: go to https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev, then select the _Code_ tab and make sure the branch _master_ is selected. Click the green _Code_ button, and then select _download ZIP_.
4. Extract/unzip the JN mod files.
5. From the JN mod files, copy the `game` folder contents (all of it) into the `game` folder of DDLC. If asked to replace files, select _Yes_.
6. From the JN mod files, copy the `lib` folder contents (all of it) into the `lib` folder of DDLC. If asked to replace files, select _Yes_.
7. You may already have a persistent from the old version of JN - this must be deleted.
    1. For Windows, you can find it here: `%APPDATA%/Roaming/RenPy/JustNatsuki`
    2. For OSX, you can find it here: `~/Library/RenPy/JustNatsuki`
    3. For Linux, you can find it here: `~/.renpy/JustNatsuki`
8. Finally, launch `DDLC.exe`.
