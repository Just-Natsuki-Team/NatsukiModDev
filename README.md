### What to expect from Just Natsuki

Just Natsuki canonically takes place following the events of DDLC+ and DDLC, and focuses on fostering and developing a relationship between a restored Natsuki and the player responsible for bringing her back from her deletion.

Enjoy finally spending some quality time with Natsuki, and explore her personality and thoughts like you've never experienced before: with unlockable games, extra features and hours of conversational topics, there's never a dull moment spent with your favorite tsundere!

Our mod has no endgame, end goal or ending - and we strive to deliver regular updates whenever we can so there's always something new to look forward to.

Well, what's the hold up?

It's rude to keep someone waiting, you know...

### Installation

*Please note that we do **not** officially support installations using mod management software, nor do we support installations from sources other than our official GitHub. DDLC+ is not supported.*

#### Using the Official JN Installer (recommended)

Download the official launcher and follow the installation steps [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModInstaller/releases/tag/release)!

#### Manual installation

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

1. Download a fresh copy of DDLC from the [official site](https://ddlc.moe). **Do not use a Steam installation**.
2. Extract/unzip DDLC.
3. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev/releases): select the ZIP file starting with `jn` (I.E `jn-1.0.0.zip`). **Do not download the source code, as this will result in future updates failing.**
4. Extract/unzip the JN mod files.
5. From the JN mod files, copy the `game` folder contents (all of it) into the `game` folder of DDLC. If asked to replace files, select _Yes_.
6. From the JN mod files, copy the `lib` folder contents (all of it) into the `lib` folder of DDLC. If asked to replace files, select _Yes_.
7. From the JN mod files, copy the `update` folder into the DDLC folder.
8. **This only applies if you have played the Just Natsuki BETA, wish to completely reset your progress, or if you are running the discontinued build from Wix/Google Drive**: You may already have a persistent from the old version of JN - this **must** be deleted.
    1. Guidance on how to find your persistent can be found [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev/wiki/04:-FAQ#can-i-back-up-my-save-data--how-do-i-find-my-persistent).
9. Finally, launch _DDLC_.
    1. If you are on OSX, you may have to review your security settings for the game to launch properly; please see the guidance listed [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev/issues/221).
10. Enjoy!

### Updating

*Use these instructions if you already have JN installed. If you are running a BETA version of JN, please follow the [Installation](#installation) steps instead.*

#### Using the Official JN Installer (recommended)

Download the official launcher and follow the update steps [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModInstaller/releases/tag/release)!

#### Manual update

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

1. Stop JN, if you are currently playing the mod and **[back up your persistent](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev/wiki/04:-FAQ#can-i-back-up-my-save-data--how-do-i-find-my-persistent)**.
2. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev/releases): select the ZIP file starting with `jn` (I.E `jn-1.0.0.zip`). **Do not download the source code, as this will result in future updates failing.**
3. Extract/unzip the new release files.
4. From the release files, copy the `game` folder contents (all of it) into the `game` folder of your JN installation. If asked to replace files, select _Yes_.
5. From the release files, copy the `lib` folder contents (all of it) into the `lib` folder of your JN installation. If asked to replace files, select _Yes_.
6. From the release files, copy the `update` folder contents (all of it) into the `update` folder of your JN installation. If asked to replace files, select _Yes_.
7. Finally, launch _DDLC_.
    1. If the game does not appear to update or displays a warning about `.rpy` files, you are running the source code (files ending in `.rpy`) instead of the release files: delete **everything** in the `game` folder, download the release files (starting with `jn`) and update using those.
8. Enjoy!

### Contribution guidelines

- Begin by forking the NatsukiModDev repository.
- Please base your changes off the most recent version-formatted branch (I.E `v1.3.0`), if one exists.
- Please **raise an issue** _before_ working on something: remember, it helps both the team and community to know what work is being undertaken so effort isn't duplicated, and so your work isn't wasted if what you are working on isn't deemed a fitting addition to the mod by the JN team.
    - Be sure that whatever you plan to work on isn't already underway, or marked as reserved by a member of the team or another contributor!
- When making a branch under your fork, please try and keep your branch naming scheme close to JN's:
    - If you are working on a feature: `feature/your-feature`
    - If you are working on a bug: `bugfix/your-bugfix`
    - If you are working on a documentation change: `docs/your-docs`
    - Remember, a branch name should be descriptive!
- When making an MR (Merge Request) from your fork, always target the most recent version-formatted branch: **please do not target master**, as this should always be stable, team-reviewed and thoroughly tested code that matches with what we are distributing in our releases. We _never_ go straight from a feature branch into `master`.
    - If a version-formatted branch does not exist, please let us know.
- See our [wiki](https://github.com/Just-Natsuki-Team/NatsukiModDev/wiki) for more information!
