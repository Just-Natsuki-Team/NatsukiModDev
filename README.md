### What to expect from Just Natsuki

Just Natsuki canonically takes place following the events of DDLC+ and DDLC, and focuses on fostering and developing a relationship between a restored Natsuki and the player responsible for bringing her back from her deletion.

Enjoy finally spending some quality time with Natsuki, and explore her personality and thoughts like you've never experienced before: with unlockable games, extra features and hours of conversational topics, there's never a dull moment spent with your favourite tsundere!

Our mod has no endgame, end goal or ending - and we strive to deliver regular updates whenever we can so there's always something new to look forward to.

Well, what's the hold up?

It's rude to keep someone waiting, you know...
